# Whisper-WebUI
A FastAPI-backed browser interface for [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper). You can use it as an Easy Subtitle Generator, and the legacy Gradio UI is still available when needed.

# Feature
- Select the Whisper implementation you want to use between :
   - [openai/whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper)
   - [SYSTRAN/faster-whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper) (used by default)
   - [Vaibhavs10/insanely-fast-whisper](https://github.com/Vaibhavs10/insanely-fast-whisper)
- Generate subtitles from various sources, including :
  - Files
  - Youtube
  - Microphone
- Currently supported subtitle formats : 
  - SRT
  - WebVTT
  - txt ( only text file without timeline )
- Speech to Text Translation 
  - From other languages to English. ( This is Whisper's end-to-end speech-to-text translation feature )
- Text to Text Translation
  - Translate subtitle files using Facebook NLLB models
  - Translate subtitle files using DeepL API
- Pre-processing audio input with [Silero VAD](https://github.com/snakers4/silero-vad).
- Pre-processing audio input to separate BGM with [UVR](https://github.com/Anjok07/ultimatevocalremovergui). 
- Post-processing with speaker diarization using the [pyannote](https://huggingface.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1) model.
   - To download the pyannote model, you need to have a Huggingface token and manually accept their terms in the pages below.

# Installation and Running

- ## Running with Pinokio

The app is able to run with [Pinokio](https://github.com/pinokiocomputer/pinokio).

1. Install [Pinokio Software](https://program.pinokio.computer/#/?id=install).
2. Open the software and search for Whisper-WebUI and install it.
3. Start the Whisper-WebUI and connect to the `http://localhost:7860`.

- ## Running with Docker 

1. Install and launch [Docker-Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

2. Git clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jhj0517/Whisper-WebUI.git
```

3. Build the image ( Image is about 7GB~ )

```sh
docker compose build
```

If you need a different PyTorch wheel index, pass it as a build argument:

```sh
docker compose build --build-arg TORCH_EXTRA_INDEX_URL=https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126
```

4. Run the container 

```sh
docker compose up
```

5. Connect to the FastAPI WebUI with your browser at `http://localhost:7860`

If you need the legacy Gradio UI for advanced CLI-driven workflows, run `python3 app.py` locally or use `start-webui.sh --legacy` / `start-webui.bat --legacy`.

If needed, update the [`docker-compose.yaml`](https://github.com/jhj0517/Whisper-WebUI/blob/master/docker-compose.yaml) to match your environment.

- ## Run Locally

### Prerequisite
On Ubuntu, install `git`, `python3`, `python3-venv`, and `ffmpeg`. Python `3.10 ~ 3.12` is recommended.

By default, the installer and Docker build use the NVIDIA CUDA 12.8 PyTorch wheel index. If you need a different wheel index, set `TORCH_EXTRA_INDEX_URL` before running the installer or pass `--build-arg TORCH_EXTRA_INDEX_URL=...` to Docker.

Please follow the links below to install the necessary software:
- git : [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- python : [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/) **`3.10 ~ 3.12` is recommended.**
- FFmpeg : [https://ffmpeg.org/download.html](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
- CUDA : [https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)

After installing FFmpeg, make sure `ffmpeg` is on your `PATH`.

### Installation Using the Script Files

1. git clone this repository
```shell
git clone https://github.com/jhj0517/Whisper-WebUI.git
```
2. Run `install.bat` or `install.sh` to install dependencies. The script creates a `venv` directory, bootstraps `pip`, `setuptools`, and `wheel`, then installs the FastAPI UI dependencies followed by the legacy Whisper package.
3. Start WebUI with `start-webui.bat` or `start-webui.sh` to launch the FastAPI UI. Use the `--legacy` flag if you want the original Gradio app instead.

If you need a non-default wheel index on Ubuntu, run:

```sh
TORCH_EXTRA_INDEX_URL=https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126 ./Install.sh
```

And you can also run the project with command line arguments if you like to, see [wiki](https://github.com/jhj0517/Whisper-WebUI/wiki/Command-Line-Arguments) for a guide to arguments.

# VRAM Usages
This project is integrated with [faster-whisper](https://github.com/guillaumekln/faster-whisper) by default for better VRAM usage and transcription speed.

According to faster-whisper, the efficiency of the optimized whisper model is as follows: 
| Implementation    | Precision | Beam size | Time  | Max. GPU memory | Max. CPU memory |
|-------------------|-----------|-----------|-------|-----------------|-----------------|
| openai/whisper    | fp16      | 5         | 4m30s | 11325MB         | 9439MB          |
| faster-whisper    | fp16      | 5         | 54s   | 4755MB          | 3244MB          |

If you want to use an implementation other than faster-whisper, use the legacy Gradio mode with `--whisper_type` and the repository name.<br>
Read [wiki](https://github.com/jhj0517/Whisper-WebUI/wiki/Command-Line-Arguments) for more info about the legacy CLI args.

If you want to use a fine-tuned model, manually place the models in `models/Whisper/` corresponding to the implementation.

Alternatively, if you enter the huggingface repo id (e.g, [deepdml/faster-whisper-large-v3-turbo-ct2](https://huggingface.co/deepdml/faster-whisper-large-v3-turbo-ct2)) in the "Model" dropdown, it will be automatically downloaded in the directory.
